## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main images active state killed me! Didn't know about creating a mask for the image. That took me most of the afternoon.
Overall trying to be better about my semantics and not breaking any html rules! 
I feel like I rely too heavily on padding to nudge all of my content around. Probably not using flexbox correctly.
Maybe next time I'll actually add some notes to my code to make it understandable to others...
